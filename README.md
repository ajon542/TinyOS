# TinyOS

## Note
This OS is based off the Meaty Skeleton article found on the OS dev wiki: http://wiki.osdev.org/Creating_an_Operating_System

One of the first steps in OS development is building a cross compiler. I have provided a script which will grab the sources for the required libraries and builds a cross compiler for the i686-elf target. The script is cross.sh and can be found in the root directory.
